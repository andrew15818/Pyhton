Idea 1: Music Service:
	-Use Spotify or other streaming service (Soundcloud/Apple Music) to access your
		fav/most played aritsts/songs
	-go through the users spotify playlist/ saved songs and recommend artists/genres of music
	-maybe pull artist's bio/img (included in artist's json)
	-If I could maybe use some sort of map or location tracker, upcoming concerts, etc...

Issues:
	-what website can I crawl and to what purpose? Extracting what?
	-If music idea, what can I do that Spotify doesnt do already
