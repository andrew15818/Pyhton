For this project, the external libraries are:
-BeautifulSoup
-Requests
-Spotipy
These libraries are included in the zip folder, otherwise they can be easy downloaded using pip install on windows.

The main motivation for this project was my interest in listening to new music, and discovering new styles and aritsts
is something that brings me great happiness, so I was greatly motivated to base my final project on something like this.
Although not everybody may find the usefulness of it, some people will enjoy it more than others.
